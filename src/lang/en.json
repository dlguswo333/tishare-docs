However, in return, we are not able to provide resources such as SSL keys to users to encrypt files flying on the networks. We do not recommend and do not take responsibility using tiShare in public and untrusted networks: such as coffee shop Wi-Fi routers. Use tiShare only in networks with trust like your home Wi-Fi networks."
